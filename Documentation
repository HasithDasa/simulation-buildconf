Envire is mainly used in navigation as a package for expressing arbitrary information about a robot's environment, but it could be extended to also include robot environment interaction for manipulation.
The reason for having a common datastructure for representing the environment is to simplify the interchange of algorithms between applications. Envire package is mainly made up of three types of objects. 

1) Maps - give information in a given reference frame.

2) Frames - provide the spatial context for the maps

2) Operators - carry out operations on maps by considering the maps' frame associations
